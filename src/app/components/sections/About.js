            Hello! My name is Fraser, and I enjoy 
            making apps for the internet. My interest 
            in programming started when I explored map 
            editors for my favorite real-time strategy 
            games. I fed this interest when I pursued 
            a computer science diploma at <a href="https://camosun.ca/">Camosun 
            College</a> in 2018. I discovered My love for 
            codding when I took my first algorithms course. 
            My passion for web development was fully formed 
            when I created a REST Node JS Express API for my 
            WordPress Capstone project. My mission to become a 
            full stack developer began.
